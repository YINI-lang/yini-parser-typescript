Dependency Security (npm audit + lockfile-lint)

- Uses npm ci --ignore-scripts: Avoids running install scripts in CI, reducing supply-chain risk.
- npm audit checks installed packages for known CVEs.
- lockfile-lint ensures the lockfile only pulls from HTTPS and the official registry and has valid integrity hashes.
- Keeps CI fast and least-privileged.
