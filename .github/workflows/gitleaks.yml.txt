Gitleaks - secret scanning

Scans commits for leaked secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials).

- Immediate secret use: secrets are available to new jobs right after savingâ€”no need to wait.
- Org vs user repos: runs with a license when GITLEAKS_LICENSE exists; otherwise runs license-free (user repos).
- Fork safety: skips on PRs from forks (secrets aren't exposed there), avoiding false failures.
- Redacted output: --redact hides secret values in logs while still flagging problems.
