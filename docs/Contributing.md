Even though `yini-parser` is in beta, your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are **highly valued**.

If you find any bugs, errors or other issues in the YINI parser, if something doesn't work as you expect, or you have other ideasâ€”please make a new issue!

## Quick Start

Head over to the [Project-Setup](./Project-Setup.md).

## Submitting Changes

Of course, you are free to fork this repo and mess around with it. ðŸ˜„  
Did you write a patch that fixes a bug, adds a new feature or implenting test cases in tests? Thank you!

- Open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch (make sure all tests pass by running `npm run test`).
- Name the branch using one of the following prefixes:
  * `fix/`  for bug fixes.
  * `update/` for updates to docs or data.
  * `feature/` for new features.
  
  **Before submitting a PR, it's a good idea to create an issue to discuss your changesâ€”so your PR is less likely to be wasted!** ðŸ™‚
