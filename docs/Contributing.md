# Contributing

- First things first, welcome!
- Feedback, bug reports, suggestions, and code contributions are welcome!
- Feedback welcome ðŸ’¬ â€” open an Issue or a Discussion.


---

Even though `yini-parser` is in beta state, your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly valued. 

If you find any bugs or errors in the `YINI` parser, something is not what you except to function, or anything else, feel free to make a new issue :)

## Quick Start

Head over to the [Development-Setup](./Project-Setup.md).

## Submitting Changes

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or other issue?

Thank you!

- Open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch (make sure all tests passes by running `npm run test`).
- Name the branch using one of the following prefixes:
  * `fix/` if the branch is meant to fix an issue.
  * `update/` if the branch updates information or data.
  * `feature/` if the branch adds a new feature.
  
  **But before that, create an issue to discuss it so that PR is less likely to be wasted!** :)
