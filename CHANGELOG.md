# CHANGELOG

## --dev/uppcoming--
- Fixed and improved number parsing to fully support negative values and edge cases for integers, floats, and exponential numbers. Based on updated lexer and parser grammar files, and added extensive tests to ensure correct and robust handling. Here: `tests/integration/6-number-literals/*`
- Fixed issues with floats, including negative and exponential numbers with new test files here: `tests/fixed-issues/issue-32/*`
- Fixed an issue where parseFile(..) did not output a warning when parsing a file missing a newline at EOF. Plus added test cases to check that it is fixed (in `tests/fixed-issues/issue-30`).

## 1.0.1-beta - 2025 Aug

- Package updated to **beta**. The core API is stabilizing, some more advanced features may still change.
- Bugfix, fixed exports cleanly (so this lib can be imported in CJS and in full ESM).
